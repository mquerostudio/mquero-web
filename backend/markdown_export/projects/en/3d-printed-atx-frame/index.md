## Project Goal

The aim of the project has been to **design **an **open and modular structure for ATX **components. The structure is focused to use** X99 motherboards** for Intel Xeon and it is possible to mount** one HDD** and one **SDD disk**.

## Files

You can find all files to print the frame on this link:

- 

I recommend that you **print the parts using ABS or PETG** so that they do not suffer thermal deformation.

The files ***HDDAntiVibrations ***and ***4xrubberFoot ***are design to print them in **TPU **or **TPE**. If you don't have any of these materials, you can print the ***HDDAntiVibrations ***in **ABS **and the ***4xrubberFoot*** do not need to be printed.

For the **HDD Caddy**, you can print the [Squirtles HDD Caddy](https://www.printables.com/model/40826-35-generic-hdd-caddy)**.**

## Important information

The **two printed parts** where the motherboard is screwed are designed for the **Machinist MR9A PRO MAX**.

**If you have another motherboard** and you can't screw it correctly because the distance between the holes is different, **message me on Instagram with the distances you need** and I will upload the updated parts ðŸ™Œ.

## Components

- Motherboard Machinist MR9A PRO MAX: 
- Processor Intel Xeon E5 2697A:  
- Cooling Block Teucer:  
- WiFi/Bluetooth card:  
- Dust Filter:  
- Screws:

## Assembly

- Screw the four foots with M4x10mm screws. If you also printed the rubber foots, you can insert them after screwing.

![Step-1](images/image-2.png)

- Insert the PSU inside the main frame and screw it with four M3x8mm screws.

![Step-2](images/image-3.png)

- First, place the TPU spacer to avoid vibrations and then place the HDD Holder above it. Screw both with four M3x8mm.

![Step-3](images/image-4.png)

- Screw the Caddy and the HDD with four M3x5mm screws and places the Caddy inside the HDD Holder.

![Step-4](images/image-5.png)

- Screw the SDD Holder above the HDD Holder with two M3X5mm screws.

![Step-5](images/image-6.png)

- Screw the SDD Disk with M3x5mm screws.

![Step-6](images/image-7.png)

- Screw both motherboard holders with four M4x14mm screws on the main frame.

![Step-7](images/image-8.png)

- Place and screw the motherboard with M3x8mm screws.

![Step-8](images/image-9.png)

- If you want to use any PCI card, screw the PCI Holder with seven M3x12mm screws.

![Step-9](images/image-10.png)

- Wire everything and insert the cables case part.
