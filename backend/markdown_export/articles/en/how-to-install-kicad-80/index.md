## What is KiCad and why use it?

KiCad is an** open source electronic design automation (EDA)** tool that is used to create **schematics** and **PCB** (printed circuit board) layouts. 

It is one of the most popular choices among the **electronics and makers community** because of its completeness and all the features it offers for **free**.

It is ideal for **designing circuits from scratch,** as it allows users to go from initial idea to manufacturing and production.

One of the main advantages of **KiCad** is that it is **open source**, and anyone can modify and improve KiCad or add functionality through **plugins**. These plugins can help you automate tasks, add new design tools and improve the overall user experience.

In fact, it has nothing to envy to other similar **paid** **programs** such as **Altium Designer or Cadence.**

## Tips for the first time you open KiCad
