I've spent the last years working on various projects that combine my technical experience with creative problem-solving.\nMy journey in electronics design started during my university years where, due to a lack of practical and modern teaching, I started learning on my own. Thus, I developed a solid foundation in circuit design, microcontroller programming, and system integration through personal projects. Since then, I've been showcasing my projects and articles on my social media with an educational purpose.\nCurrently, we have created kode, a startup with which we want to revolutionize the way people learn about hardware and software.",
